I received a command to Google the invention of the chariot and its evolution into the war chariot. The search returned several results, including the origin of the chariot in Mesopotamia around 3000 BCE, the introduction of the composite bow around 2000 BCE, and the use of chariots as essential war machines. I then wrote a summary of this information and saved it to a file called "chariot_research.txt".
