}Command read_file returned: The invention of the chariot is believed to have occurred around 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia. The earliest chariots had solid wheels and were pulled by a pair of oxen. The introduction of the composite bow around 2000 BCE and its employment by charioteers made the chariot an essential war machine. Composite bows were made by gluing wood, horn and sinew together, creating a vastly superior weapon over the self bow made of wood alone.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:
