I used the "google" command to search for information on the origins and meanings of the name Xuanyuan and its significance in Chinese mythology and history. The search returned several sources that provide information on the topic. My computer returned results that include the meaning and history of the name Xuanyuan, its connection to the Yellow Emperor, and its use in Chinese mythology and religion. 

I followed my assistant's plan and used the "read_file" command to refresh my memory on the information I found earlier. I took notes on the most relevant information on the origins and meanings of the name Xuanyuan and its significance in Chinese mythology and history. Then, I used the "append_to_file" command to add my notes to the "chariot_research.txt" file and saved them using the "write_to_file" command. My computer returned information on the invention of the chariot, which is believed to have occurred around 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia. The earliest chariots had solid wheels and were pulled by a pair of oxen. The introduction of the composite bow around 2000 BCE and its employment by charioteers made the chariot an essential war machine. Composite bows were made by gluing wood, horn and sinew together, creating a vastly superior weapon over the self bow made of wood alone. I will now start thinking about how I can analyze the possible connections between the invention of the war chariot and the use of the name Xuanyuan in ancient China.{
