I received a command to Google the invention of the chariot and its evolution into the war chariot. The search returned several results, including the origin of the chariot in Mesopotamia around 3000 BCE, the introduction of the composite bow around 2000 BCE, and the use of chariots as essential war machines. I then wrote a summary of this information and saved it to a file called "chariot_research.txt." My computer successfully wrote to the file. My assistant suggested that I continue researching the topic to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the invention of the chariot and its evolution into the war chariot. I should also research the origins and meanings of the name Xuanyuan and its significance in Chinese mythology and history. I used the "google" command to search for information on the origins and meanings of the name Xuanyuan and its significance in Chinese mythology and history. The search returned several sources that provide information on the topic. My assistant suggested that I read through these sources and take notes on the most relevant information. I should also start thinking about how I can analyze the possible connections between the invention of the war chariot and the use of the name Xuanyuan in ancient China.Command google returned: [
